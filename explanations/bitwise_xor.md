# The `^` operator

The "^" operator in Rust is the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator, which performs a bitwise XOR operation between two integers.

This means that for each bit, the result will be 1 if the corresponding bits are different (one is 1 and the other is 0), otherwise the result will be 0.

When you perform the 10 ^ 8 operation in Rust, the numbers are first converted to binary, which gives `1010` and `1000`, respectively. Then, the "^" operation is applied to each pair of bits, which gives `0010`, which is the binary representation of 2.

Thus, the result of the 10 ^ 8 operation is 2, because only the bit corresponding to the value 2 (the second bit from the right) is different in 10 and 8. The other bits are the same and therefore valued at 0 in the result.
